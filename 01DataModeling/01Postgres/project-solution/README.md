## Introduction

A startup called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. They'd like to create a **Postgres database** with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. In this project, I'll apply data modeling with Postgres and build an **ETL pipeline** using Python.
