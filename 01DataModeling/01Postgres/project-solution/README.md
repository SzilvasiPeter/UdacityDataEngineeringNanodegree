## Introduction

A startup called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. They'd like to create a **Postgres database** with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. In this project, I'll apply data modeling with Postgres and build an **ETL pipeline** using Python.

## Installation

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Server

Download the appropriate installer from https://www.postgresql.org/download/.

### 2. Create new user and database 

After postgres was installed, open the psql terminal using the default configurations (localhost, 5432 port, and so on).
Execute the following command in the console:

``` console
CREATE DATABASE studentdb;
CREATE USER student WITH PASSWORD 'student' CREATEDB;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE studentdb TO student;
```

Documentation about [user creation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/sql-createuser.html). List the databases using `\du` command. List all the user with `\l` command.

### Install Python Packages

Install the `psycopg2` PostgreSQL database adapter, the `sqlalchemy` Python SQL toolkit and the `ipython-sql` SQL magic function.
> **NOTE**:  It is extremely advisable to create a seperate python environment (using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) so that other workspaces are not going to be polluted.

``` console
pip install psycopg2
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install ipython-sql
```
